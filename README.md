## 1. Concept & Idea

### 📌 Concept
**Name:** Lumina
**Description:**
Lumina is an app that allows users to consciously and systematically monitor their mental well-being. 
Users can track their emotions daily and analyze trends in their mental wellness. 
The goal is to make mental health visible in an accessible and visual way.

### 🧩 Problems You Solve
Many people struggle to keep track of their emotions or mental health. They write down their feelings in scattered apps, notebooks, or not at all. 
They often forget self-care routines or miss the bigger picture.

Lumina solves this by offering a central place where users can log their emotions, sleep, weather, and thoughts. 
Based on that data, the app provides visual insights and moments of reflection.

* **Centralization**: All mental health data in one comprehensive platform
* **Consistency**: Daily tracking becomes intuitive and accessible
* **Insight**: Complex emotional patterns are made visual and understandable
* **Action**: Concrete recommendations for improved mental health

### 👥 Target Audience
* Young adults and students
* People focused on personal growth
* Individuals in therapy or looking for mental health support
* Anyone interested in mindful emotional tracking

They're looking for a simple and consistent way to get a grip on their emotional patterns, understand themselves better, and take care of their well-being.
